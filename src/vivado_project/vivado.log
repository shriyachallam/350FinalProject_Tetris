CRITICAL WARNING: [filemgmt 20-742] The top module "VGAController" specified for this project can not be validated. The current project is using automatic hierarchy update mode, and hence a new suitable replacement top will be automatically selected. If this is not desired, please change the hierarchy update mode to one of the manual compile order modes first, and then set top to any desired value.
Resolution: To switch to manual update order go to the Sources view, right-click on any node in the hierarchy and in the context menu select: 'Hierarchy Update' option 'No Update' or run the following Tcl Command: set_property source_mgmt_mode None [current_project] (which is the Manual Compile Order mode).
